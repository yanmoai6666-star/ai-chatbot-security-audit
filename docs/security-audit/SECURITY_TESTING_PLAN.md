# Security Testing Plan

## Overview
Comprehensive security testing strategy for AI chatbot system, covering penetration testing, vulnerability scanning, and compliance verification.

## Testing Objectives
1. Identify and remediate security vulnerabilities
2. Validate security controls effectiveness
3. Ensure regulatory compliance
4. Establish continuous security monitoring

## Testing Methodology

### 1. Penetration Testing
**Scope:** Full application stack including AI components  
**Frequency:** Quarterly + after major releases  
**Tools:** OWASP ZAP, Burp Suite, Custom scripts

#### Test Cases
```yaml
penetration_tests:
  - name: "SQL Injection Testing"
    target: "All user input endpoints"
    techniques: ["union-based", "error-based", "blind"]
    severity: "Critical"
    
  - name: "Authentication Bypass"
    target: "Auth middleware"
    techniques: ["token manipulation", "session hijacking"]
    severity: "Critical"
    
  - name: "XSS Testing"
    target: "Response rendering"
    techniques: ["reflected", "stored", "DOM-based"]
    severity: "High"
```

### 2. Automated Security Scanning
**Tools:**
- **SAST:** SonarQube, Semgrep
- **DAST:** OWASP ZAP, Nessus
- **SCA:** Snyk, Dependabot
- **Container:** Trivy, Clair

**Schedule:**
- Daily dependency scans
- Weekly SAST scans
- Monthly DAST scans
- Pre-production full scans

### 3. AI Model Security Testing
**Focus Areas:**
- Model poisoning detection
- Adversarial input resistance
- Output sanitization
- Training data integrity

**Techniques:**
- Gradient-based attacks
- Model inversion attacks
- Membership inference
- Data poisoning simulations

## Test Environment

### Staging Environment
```bash
# Test environment configuration
ENVIRONMENT=staging
SECURITY_SCANNING=enabled
AUTOMATED_TESTS=enabled
PENETRATION_TESTING=enabled
```

### Test Data
- Synthetic user data with various attack patterns
- Malicious input samples
- Edge case scenarios
- Compliance test cases

## Testing Schedule

### Q4 2025 Testing Plan
| Test Type | Schedule | Duration | Resources |
|-----------|----------|----------|-----------|
| Initial Pen Test | 2025-09-15 | 5 days | Security Team |
| SAST Scan | Weekly | 2 hours | Automated |
| DAST Scan | Monthly | 1 day | Security Team |
| Compliance Audit | 2025-10-01 | 3 days | Compliance Team |
| Model Security | 2025-10-15 | 2 days | AI Team |

## Risk-Based Testing Approach

### Critical Risk Areas
1. **Authentication & Authorization**
   - Test all auth endpoints
   - Validate session management
   - Check privilege escalation

2. **Input Validation**
   - SQL injection testing
   - XSS validation
   - Command injection
   - File inclusion

3. **Data Protection**
   - Encryption validation
   - Access controls
   - Data leakage prevention

### High Risk Areas
1. **API Security**
   - Endpoint authorization
   - Rate limiting
   - Input sanitization

2. **Configuration Security**
   - Hardening validation
   - Secret management
   - Environment security

3. **AI Model Security**
   - Adversarial robustness
   - Data poisoning resistance
   - Output validation

## Test Automation Strategy

### CI/CD Integration
```yaml
# GitHub Actions workflow example
name: Security Testing
on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  security-scan:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: SAST Scan
        uses: github/codeql-action@v2
      - name: Dependency Scan
        uses: snyk/actions@v1
      - name: Container Scan
        uses: aquasecurity/trivy-action@v1
```

### Automated Test Cases
1. **Pre-commit Hooks**
   - Secret detection
   - Code quality checks
   - Basic security validation

2. **PR Validation**
   - Security regression tests
   - Vulnerability scanning
   - Compliance checks

3. **Production Monitoring**
   - Real-time threat detection
   - Anomaly detection
   - Attack pattern recognition

## Metrics and Reporting

### Key Performance Indicators
- **Vulnerability Density:** < 0.1 vulnerabilities/kloc
- **Time to Remediate:** < 7 days for critical issues
- **Test Coverage:** > 90% security-critical code
- **Compliance Score:** > 95% framework adherence

### Reporting Structure
1. **Daily:** Automated scan results
2. **Weekly:** Vulnerability status report
3. **Monthly:** Comprehensive security assessment
4. **Quarterly:** Executive security briefing

## Remediation Process

### Vulnerability Management
1. **Triage:** Within 24 hours of discovery
2. **Prioritization:** Based on CVSS scores
3. **Remediation:** According to SLA
4. **Verification:** Post-fix validation testing
5. **Documentation:** Lessons learned archive

### SLAs for Critical Issues
| Severity | Response Time | Fix Time |
|----------|---------------|----------|
| Critical | 2 hours | 24 hours |
| High | 8 hours | 7 days |
| Medium | 24 hours | 30 days |
| Low | 48 hours | 90 days |

## Continuous Improvement

### Feedback Loop
1. Post-mortem analysis after security incidents
2. Regular tooling evaluation and updates
3. Training and skill development
4. Process optimization based on metrics

### Technology Updates
- Quarterly security tool evaluation
- Bi-annual penetration testing methodology review
- Annual compliance framework updates
