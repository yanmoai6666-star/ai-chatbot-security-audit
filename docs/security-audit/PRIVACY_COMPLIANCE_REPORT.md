| Data in Transit | ❌ None | Critical risk |
| Database | ❌ None | Critical risk |
| Backups | ❌ None | Critical risk |

### Access Controls
| Control | Status | Notes |
|---------|---------|-------|
| Authentication | 🟡 Partial | Basic implementation |
| Authorization | 🔴 Missing | No role-based access |
| Audit Logging | 🔴 Missing | No access logging |
| Session Management | 🟡 Partial | Basic sessions |

## Remediation Plan

1. Implement data encryption for sensitive information
2. Create data retention policy
3. Establish access control mechanisms
4. Implement audit logging

### Short-term Actions (2-4 weeks)
1. Develop consent management system
2. Create data breach response plan
3. Implement user data access mechanisms
4. Establish data deletion processes

### Long-term Actions (1-3 months)

4. Missing data retention policy

### Medium Risk Items
1. Limited audit logging
2. Basic authentication only
3. No data breach response
4. Incomplete documentation

### Compliance Timeline
